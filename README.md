Data Challenge Assignment
Introduction
This project is part of a data challenge assignment for Pathrise, an online program that provides mentorship, training, and advice to help job seekers secure positions in the tech industry. The dataset provided includes information collected from fellows who joined the program, and the goal is to derive insights into whether a fellow will ultimately be placed at a company and how long until a placement can be expected.

Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to predict the likelihood of a fellow being placed at a company and estimate the time until placement. The insights gained from this analysis are crucial for Pathrise to understand the factors influencing fellows' outcomes and make informed decisions.

Dataset
The dataset includes information on fellows from the moment they joined the program. It is important to note that the dataset may not be perfect, reflecting the real-world challenges in data collection.

Analysis Approach
The analysis will involve deploying analytical techniques to address the following questions:

Will a fellow ultimately be placed at a company?
How long until a placement can be expected?
The focus will be on understanding the thought process behind the analytical techniques used and translating the findings into actionable recommendations for the company.
