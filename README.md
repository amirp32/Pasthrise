# Pathrise Data Challenge Project

## Introduction

This project is part of a data challenge assignment for Pathrise, an online program that empowers job seekers in the tech industry through mentorship, training, and guidance. The dataset provided contains information collected from fellows who participated in the program. The main objective is to derive insights into the likelihood of a fellow being placed at a company and estimate the time until placement.

## Objective

The primary goal of this analysis is to predict the probability of a fellow being placed at a company and to estimate the duration until placement. These insights are essential for Pathrise to understand the factors influencing fellows' outcomes and make informed decisions to enhance the program's effectiveness.

## Dataset

The dataset encompasses information about fellows from the point of joining the program. It's crucial to acknowledge that the dataset may have imperfections, mirroring the challenges often encountered in real-world data collection.

## Analysis Approach

### The analysis will employ various analytical techniques to address the following key questions:

### 1.Will a fellow ultimately be placed at a company?

### 2.How long until a placement can be expected?

The focus of the analysis is not only on providing accurate predictions but also on understanding the underlying thought process behind the analytical techniques used. The goal is to translate the findings into actionable recommendations for the benefit of the Pathrise program. The project emphasizes transparency and a comprehensive understanding of the data, ensuring the insights derived are robust and reliable.
